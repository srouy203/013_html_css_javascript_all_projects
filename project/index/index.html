                <h3>Biology</h3>
                <p>Students studying in the Department of Biology gain knowledge about plants and animals, and build crucial laboratory research and fieldwork skills. Students spend the first year studying the Foundation Studies course, and the remainder of their degree gaining a solid grounding in general biology. Increasingly, the Cambodian market demands laboratory-trained professionals in the agricultural, medical and food production industries. All the degrees offered by the Department of Biology teach students the skills they will need to work in medical laboratories, plant breeding farms, beer brewing or food production plants. Graduates may also work for environmental organizations, relevant government ministries or undertake further training to become teachers in their own right.</p>
